# ThreeSideCalc

The problem to slove:

Three tenants want to share the bills equaly. Each tenant pays a different bill. Considering that the bills aren't equal in value, what transfers do they have to perform in order for each to have paid the same amount at the end?


To run it:

1. prerequisites: java and maven installed
2. run "mvn package" in project folder (it generates target/payment-management.jar)
3. run "java -jar payment-management.jar" from target folder
