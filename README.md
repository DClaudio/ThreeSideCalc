# ThreeSideCalc

The problem to slove:

Three tenants share the bills equaly . Each tenant pays one bill. Considering that the bills aren't equal in value, what payments do they have to give yo each other in order for each to pay the same amount?


To run it:

1. prerequisites: java and maven installed
2. run "mvn package" in project folder (it generates target/payment-management.jar)
3. run "java -jar payment-management.jar" from target folder
